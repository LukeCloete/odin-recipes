        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>For the Dipping Sauce:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup blue cheese crumbles</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. hot sauce</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix together the flour, garlic powder, 
            onion powder, smoked paprika, salt, cayenne pepper, 
            and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dredge the chicken wings in the flour mixture, 
            making sure to coat each wing thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the vegetable oil in a large, 
            deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it reaches 350Â°F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working in batches, fry the chicken wings in the hot oil for about 10-12 minutes, 
            or until they're crispy and golden brown. 
            Drain the wings on a wire rack or paper towels to remove any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix together the Greek yogurt, blue cheese crumbles, 
            mayonnaise, lemon juice, hot sauce, salt, and pepper to make the dipping sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the Dunked Wings hot, with the dipping sauce on the side. Enjoy!
