        <li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
        <li>4 small red potatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.</li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, toss the potatoes, carrot, onion, 
            and rosemary with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. 
            Spread the vegetables out on a baking sheet and season them with salt and pepper. 
            Roast the vegetables in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they're tender and golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the vegetables are roasting, 
            season the filet mignon steaks with salt and pepper on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and 1 
            tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the skillet is hot, add the filet mignon steaks and 
            sear them for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they develop a nice crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet, 
            along with the thyme sprigs and smashed garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon the butter and herbs over the steaks while they cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, 
            or until they reach the desired level of doneness.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Serve the Filet Mignon hot, with the roasted vegetables and creamy mashed potato on the side. 
            Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Enjoy!
        </li>
